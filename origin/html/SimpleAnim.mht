<P><STRONG>SimpleAnim</STRONG> is sample C code illustrating the use of =
OpenGL.=20
&nbsp; It is intended to accompany the book <EM><STRONG>3D Computer =
Graphics: A=20
mathematical approach with OpenGL</STRONG>, </EM>by Samuel R. Buss, =
Cambridge=20
University Press, 2003. &nbsp; However, it can be used independently as=20
well.</P>
<P><STRONG>SimpleAnim </STRONG>rotates three overlapping =
triangles.&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
It consists of two source files, <STRONG>SimpleAnim.c</STRONG> and=20

<P><STRONG>Things to try out:</STRONG>=20
<OL>
  <LI>Compile and run the program.&nbsp; Try out the keyboard =
controls.&nbsp;=20
  Pressing "r" starts and stops the animation.&nbsp; Pressing "s" =
performs=20
  single steps of the animation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The up and down arrows =
control the=20
  speed of the rotation.=20
  <LI>Observe aliasing problems with the borders of the triangles.&nbsp; =
To do=20
  this enlarge the window for a better view.&nbsp; Then slow down the =
rotation=20
  until the triangles are turning slowly.&nbsp; Along the edges of the =
triangles=20
  you should see jagged edges and/or movement of pixels.&nbsp; The =
narrow tips=20
  of the triangles may look very "jumpy" when observed carefully at slow =

  rotation rates.=20
  <LI>This program uses double buffering in order to make the animation =
look=20
  good. &nbsp; Experiment by changing the program to use single =
buffering.&nbsp;=20
  To use single buffering, change the parameter =
<STRONG>GLUT_DOUBLE</STRONG> to=20
  <STRONG>GLUT_SINGLE</STRONG> and comment out the call to=20
  <STRONG>glutSwapBuffers().</STRONG>&nbsp; How does the animation look =
in=20
  single buffer mode?=20
  <LI>Near the beginning of the <STRONG>drawScene</STRONG> routine, the =
current=20
  angle is clamped to be less than 360 degrees.&nbsp; What would go =
wrong if=20
  this was removed from the code.&nbsp; Try making this change.&nbsp; =
What goes=20
  wrong?&nbsp; (To make things go wrong faster, run the simulation at a =
high=20
  rate for a little while, then at a low rate: you need to run it long =
enough to=20
  let overflow/underflow errors become significant.) &nbsp; Is it what =
you=20
  expected?&nbsp; Can you explain what is happening?&nbsp; Similarly, =
what goes=20
  wrong if the value of <STRONG>AnimateIncrement</STRONG> is allowed to =
get too=20
  large?&nbsp; (Or too small?).=20
  <LI>Understand how the <STRONG>glTranslatef</STRONG> and=20
  <STRONG>glRotatef</STRONG> work. &nbsp; These commands are described =
in=20
  chapter 2 of the book. </LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
