<P><STRONG>LightTorus</STRONG> is a C program illustrating the use of =
OpenGL.=20
&nbsp; It is intended to accompany the book <EM><STRONG>3D Computer =
Graphics: A=20
mathematical approach with OpenGL</STRONG>, </EM>by S. Buss, Cambridge=20
University Press, 2003. &nbsp; However, it can be used independently as=20
well.</P>
<P><STRONG>LightTorus </STRONG>draws a torus in a non-standard way, as a =
ribbon=20
of quad strips that wrap around the torus in one long strip.&nbsp; The C =
code=20
consists of two source files, <STRONG>LightTorus.c</STRONG> and=20
<STRONG>LightTorus.h.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several options =
available=20

  <LI>Compile and run the program.&nbsp; Test out the keyboard =
controls.&nbsp;=20
  The controls j.-l. are new and not in <STRONG>WrapTorus.</STRONG>
  <OL type=3Da>
    <LI>Press arrow keys (left, right, up and down) to make the torus =
rotate.=20
    <LI>Press "s" to single step the animation,=20
    <LI>Press "a" to start the animation running again without =
stopping.&nbsp;=20
    (Undoes the "s" effect.)=20
    <LI>Press "r" to reset the torus back to its original orientation =
with no=20
    velocity.=20
    <LI>Press "0" (zero) to zero the velocity of the torus, but leave =
its=20
    position fixed.=20
    <LI>Press "W" to increase the number of wraps,&nbsp; "w" to decrease =
the=20
    number of wraps.=20
    <LI>Press "N" to increase the number of segments per wrap.&nbsp; "n" =
to=20
    decrease the number of segments per wrap.=20
    <LI>Press "q" to toggle between drawing quadrangles and triangles.=20
    <LI>Press "p" to toggle between rendering in filled polygon mode, =
and in=20
    wireframe mode.=20
    <LI>Press "f" to toggle between flat shading and smooth shading.=20
    <LI>Press "0" (zero) and "1" (one) to toggle the lights (Light #0 =
and light=20
    #1) off and on.=20
    <LI>Press "l" to toggle local mode off and on.&nbsp; This command =
switches=20
    between having a local viewer and a positional light and having a =
non-local=20
    viewer (i.e., positioned at a point at infinity) and a directional =
light.=20
    </LI></OL>
  <LI>Observe how the torus now looks three-dimensional in "filled =
polygon"=20
  mode. (Keyboard control: "p".)&nbsp; This is a big improvement over =
the=20
  <STRONG>WrapTorus</STRONG> program, and is caused by the use of =
material=20
  properties and Phong lighting.&nbsp;=20
  <LI>Try toggling the lights off and on. Observe the effects both =
diffuse=20
  lighting and specular highlights.&nbsp; Why is the torus still visible =
when=20
  both lights are turned off? (Ans: global ambient light.)&nbsp; Why =
does the=20
  torus look completely flat shaded, with no three-dimensionality, when =
both=20
  lights are turned off?=20
  <LI>When toggling local mode off and on, observe how the specular =
highlights=20
  change.&nbsp; This is due to the changes in the light vector=20
  <STRONG>l</STRONG> and and the view vector <STRONG>v</STRONG>.=20
  <LI>Experiment with increasing the resolution of the mesh (controls =
"N" and=20
  "W").&nbsp; At what point does the torus look smooth? &nbsp; You =
answer will=20
  vary depending on whether you are in local mode, and whether the torus =

  animation is running. </LI></OL>
