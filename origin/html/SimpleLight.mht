<P><STRONG>SimpleLight</STRONG> is sample C code illustrating the use of =
OpenGL.=20
&nbsp; It is intended to accompany the book <EM><STRONG>3D Computer =
Graphics: A=20
mathematical approach with OpenGL</STRONG>, </EM>by Samuel R. Buss, =
Cambridge=20
University Press, 2003. &nbsp; However, it can be used independently as=20
well.</P>
<P><STRONG>SimpleLight </STRONG>illustrates the use Phong lighting in=20
OpenGL.&nbsp; It draws six spheres of different colors, and makes a =
white light=20
revolve around the spheres.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists of two source files, =

<STRONG>SimpleLight.c</STRONG> and =
<STRONG>SimpleLight.h.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
There are several options available for downloading this program:=20

<P><STRONG>Things to notice:</STRONG>=20
<OL>
  <LI>Compile and run the program.&nbsp; Try out the keyboard =
controls.&nbsp;=20
  Pressing "r" starts and stops the animation.&nbsp; Pressing "s" =
performs=20
  single steps of the animation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The up and down arrows =
control the=20
  speed of the rotation.&nbsp; Pressing "l" (for local) switches between =
a=20
  positional light and a directional light.=20
  <LI>Note the specular hightlights.=20
  <LI>Note how the diffuse illumination is brightest facing the light, =
and dims=20
  quickly as the surface normals move away from facing the light source. =

  <LI>Note how the bright center of diffuse illumination is not at the =
same=20
  position as the specular hightlight.&nbsp; What is this?=20
  <LI>Note that there is some ambient light (both global ambient light =
and=20
  anbient light from light #0).&nbsp; For this reason, the sides of the =
spheres=20
  facing away the light source are not completely dark.=20
  <LI>Note how the specular highlights change position when the light =
switches=20
  between directional and positional.&nbsp; Note how the diffuse =
lighting=20
  changes when the light switch is made.&nbsp; Explain qualitatively why =
you see=20
  the changes you do.=20
  <LI>The six spheres and the light are all in the same plane (the=20
  xy-plane).&nbsp; Why don't the spheres cast shadows on each other?=20
  <LI>Note how the program used emissive properties to make the light =
glow=20
  white. &nbsp; However the fact that the white sphere is visible is =
independent=20
  of the fact that the light is active and shining. =
