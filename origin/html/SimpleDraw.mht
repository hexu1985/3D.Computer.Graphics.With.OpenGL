<P><STRONG>SimpleDraw</STRONG> is sample C code illustrating the use of =
OpenGL.=20
&nbsp; It is intended to accompany the book <EM><STRONG>3D Computer =
Graphics: A=20
mathematical approach with OpenGL</STRONG>, </EM>by S. Buss, Cambridge=20
University Press, 2003. &nbsp; However, it can be used independently as=20
well.</P>
<P><STRONG>SimpleDraw </STRONG>shows how to draw points, lines, line =
strips and=20
line loops.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists of two source files,=20
<STRONG>SimpleDraw.c</STRONG> and =
<STRONG>SimpleDraw.h.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
There are several options available for downloading this program:=20

<P><STRONG>Things to try out:</STRONG>=20
<OL>
  <LI>Compile and run the program.&nbsp; Use the space bar to toggle =
between the=20
  five images. &nbsp;&nbsp; Examine the source code and figure out how =
each of=20
  the five figures is drawn in the routine <STRONG>drawScene().</STRONG> =

  <LI>Uncomment out the blocks of code in =
<STRONG>initRendering()</STRONG> and=20
  recompile and re-run.&nbsp; (First uncomment the first block, then =
uncomment=20
  both blocks.)&nbsp; How does this effect what the graphics images look =
like on=20
  your computer?=20
  <LI>Understand the purposes of the call backs that were set up by =
calls to=20
  <STRONG>glutKeyboardFunc(), &nbsp; glutReshapeFunc(),&nbsp;=20
  glutDisplayFunc().</STRONG>&nbsp; Understand what the call to=20
  <STRONG>glutMainLoop()</STRONG> does.&nbsp; Understand how the program =

  responds to the space bar and the escape key.=20
  <LI>This program does not use double buffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand =
what=20
  this means. &nbsp; What is the purpose of the call to=20
  <STRONG>glutPostRedisplay()</STRONG> after the mode is changed? =
